# FireEDA

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
Feature Engineering: Deriving new features and transforming existing features to better expose patterns to modeling algorithms.
Model Selection: Evaluating several machine learning models to select the one that provides the best accuracy and robustness.
Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's effectiveness and to avoid overfitting.
