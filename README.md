Forest Fire Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains data from two regions in Algeria and includes various meteorological variables and other information aimed at analyzing and identifying factors influencing forest fires. The data encompasses weather observations and components of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system to predict or analyze the occurrence of fires.

Key Columns:
Date: The date of the weather observation (day/month/year).
Temperature (Temp): Noon temperature (maximum temperature) in Celsius, ranging from 22 to 42 degrees.
Relative Humidity (RH): Relative humidity as a percentage, ranging from 21% to 90%.
Wind Speed (Ws): Wind speed in km/h, ranging from 6 to 29 km/h.
Rain: Total daily rainfall in mm, ranging from 0 to 16.8 mm.
FWI Components: Several indexes from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system:
FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code): Measures the moisture content in fine fuels.
DMC (Duff Moisture Code): Measures the moisture in the leaf litter layer.
DC (Drought Code): Measures the long-term dryness.
ISI (Initial Spread Index): Measures the initial spread potential of a fire.
FWI (Fire Weather Index): An overall index to assess fire risk.
Classes: Indicates whether a fire occurred or not (Fire / No Fire).
Purpose of the Dataset:
The dataset aims to help researchers and specialists predict the occurrence of fires by analyzing meteorological patterns and factors that contribute to fire outbreaks. This can aid in improving rapid response and taking preventive measures to reduce the risk of fires.
